# Recipe App

A simple recipe search app for cocktails. The app will allow users to search for cocktails by name, ingredient etc. The app will also allow users to view details about a specific cocktail, such as the ingredients and instructions on how to make it. The app will be built using vanilla JavaScript and it will be single-page application.

## Project requirements per HYF

- The app needs to be responsive
- The app needs to be a single-page application. There can be only one HTML file. And the JavaScript will change the content of the page using DOM manipulation.
- The app needs to fetch data from an API.
- The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interactions with the API and needs to show this to the user. not just console.log.
- The app needs some user interaction. such that you need to grab different data from the API. so you can not just grab everything from API and store it locally with one fetch call.
- no Code along's.
- Follow the  guidelines at <https://github.com/HackYourFuture/ta_guidelines>
